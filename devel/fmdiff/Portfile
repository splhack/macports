description     Wrapper scripts for FileMerge
long_description Apple's Developer Tools for Mac OS X include FileMerge, \
    a graphical tool to compare and merge files. FileMerge can be much \
    handier to use, unfortunately, it doesn't integrate with Subversion \
    straightforwardly. It can be opened from the command line with \
    the opendiff command, but its interface differs from that of diff \
    and diff3. It returns immediately (i.e. it forks and does not block) \
    and it expects different arguments. Some wrapper scripts are thus \
    required to call FileMerge from Subversion.
