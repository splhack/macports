FileMerge can be much handier to use, unfortunately, it doesn't integrate with Subversion straightforwardly. It can be opened from the command line with the opendiff command, but its interface differs from that of diff and diff3. It returns immediately (i.e. it forks and does not block) and it expects different arguments. Some wrapper scripts are thus required to call FileMerge from Subversion.} categories devel version 13456 revision 0
